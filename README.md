# hand_gesture_number_recog

Convolutional Neural Network to recognize hand gestures.
 
# Prerequisite:
Python 3, OpenCV, Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras

# Guide:
Using Keras with Tensorflow backend on Manjaro Linux. This code should run on Windows as well.
Run collect_sample.py to execute the program.  

# Dataset:
I created the dataset on my own. More images can be added using collect_data.py.
